# PerformanceGraph

This project shows how to build a custom view to display performance graphs (i.e brain maps or football player skills).

The graph resizes depending on the space assigned to the view and is built considering dp measures, looking good in any screen size.
It is also possible to add as many polygons/graphs to the view as wanted (to compare performances for example). Just add a new PerformanceGraph object in setSkills method and call drawPerformancePolygon in the onDraw method.
